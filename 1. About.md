My name is Eric Young.  
I am a Research Scientist, a Senior Lecturer, and a Mechanical Engineer dedicated to making **mechatronics and robotics** *"more fun, visual, and accessible to everyone."*

Together with industry partners, researchers, and students,  
I conduct applied research on solutions that advance **automation, improve robotics systems, and simplify their integration into everyday applications.**

My favorite approach is *"Build it to understand it."*  
I develop innovative systems, tools, and techniques that:  
1) deliver *domain-specific* solutions for engineers, hobbyists, and educators; and  
2) provide *flexible frameworks* for designing and deploying mechatronic systems.

My main focus areas and impact topics include **robotics, mechatronics, and automation-driven education.**  
I am passionate about integrating robotics into teaching and research, developing autonomous systems, and enabling hands-on learning through engaging tools and experiments.

Here, on my personal home page and blog,  
I share updates about my activities, research projects, and publications.  
Below are some examples of my roles and projects.


* **Lecturer.** Experienced educator and speaker, specializing in topics such as robotics, mechatronics, automation engineering, and system integration.

* **Supervisor.** Advisor for Master's thesis projects, mentoring students on applied research and innovative engineering solutions.

* **Academic Service.** Active contributor to academic communities as a program committee (PC) member, reviewer, and organizer for conferences and workshops.

* **Consortium Partner.** Research project collaborator, leader, or principal investigator, managing tasks such as project planning, execution, monitoring, and reporting.
